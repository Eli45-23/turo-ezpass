## ðŸŽ® How to Use

### Automatic Activation
Subagents automatically activate based on context:
```bash
# Working on Terraform - terraform-expert activates
cd api/terraform && terraform plan

# Debugging scrapers - scraper-specialist activates
cd app/scripts/scrapers && node turo.js

# React development - frontend-specialist activates
cd dashboard && npm start
```

### Explicit Invocation
Request specific subagents:
```
> Use the terraform-expert to optimize our infrastructure costs
> Have the security-auditor review our authentication implementation
> Ask the api-specialist to debug the Lambda timeout issues
> Get the scraper-specialist to improve EZPass reliability
> Have the frontend-specialist optimize the dashboard performance
> Use the analytics-specialist to create a business metrics dashboard
```

## âš¡ Speed Improvements Expected

### Before Subagents:
- Generic responses requiring multiple iterations
- Context switching between different expertise areas
