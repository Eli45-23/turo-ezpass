- Provide cost allocation and chargeback reports

**Common Analysis Queries:**
```bash
# CloudWatch Logs Insights examples
fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /ERROR/
stats count(*) by bin(5m) | sort @timestamp desc

# Custom metrics creation
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --namespace "TuroEZPass" --metric-data MetricName=TripProcessingSuccess,Value=1,Unit=Count

# Dashboard creation
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard --dashboard-name "TuroEZPass-Overview" --dashboard-body file://dashboard.json
```

**Reporting Automation:**
- Create scheduled reports using analytics Lambda
- Generate executive summaries and KPI reports
- Implement automated anomaly detection reports
- Build trend analysis and forecasting reports
- Set up data export for external analysis tools

Always provide specific CloudWatch queries, metric definitions, and actionable insights with concrete recommendations for system improvements.
