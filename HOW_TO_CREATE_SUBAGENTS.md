## Understanding Subagents

### What are Subagents?

Claude Code subagents are specialized AI assistants that:
- **Focus on specific domains** (e.g., frontend, security, infrastructure)
- **Use dedicated context windows** (no pollution of main conversation)
- **Have customized system prompts** for their expertise area
- **Can access specific tools** based on their needs
- **Activate automatically** based on context or explicit requests

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context Preservation** | Each subagent maintains its own context, keeping the main conversation focused |
| **Specialized Expertise** | Domain-specific knowledge and patterns for better results |
| **Improved Performance** | Targeted responses with 80%+ faster problem resolution |
| **Reusability** | Once created, can be used across projects and shared with teams |
| **Flexible Permissions** | Granular tool access control for security and efficiency |

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Using the `/agents` Command (Recommended)

```bash
# Open the subagents interface
/agents
```

This provides an interactive menu to:
- View all available subagents
- Create new subagents with guided setup
- Edit existing subagents
- Manage tool permissions
- Delete subagents

### Method 2: Manual File Creation

```bash
# Create project-level subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
touch .claude/agents/your-subagent-name.md

# Create user-level subagent (available across all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
touch ~/.claude/agents/your-subagent-name.md
```

### Method 3: Generate with Claude (Recommended)

Ask Claude to help create your subagent:

```
> Create a subagent for [your specific domain] that specializes in [specific tasks]. 
> It should be used for [when to use it] and have expertise in [technologies/areas].
```

---

## Subagent Structure

### File Locations and Priority

| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Project Subagents** | `.claude/agents/` | Current project only | Highest |
| **User Subagents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects | Lower |

**Note**: When names conflict, project-level subagents override user-level ones.

### File Format

Every subagent follows this Markdown structure:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When and why this subagent should be used
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all if omitted
---

Your detailed system prompt goes here.

This can be multiple paragraphs and should clearly define:
- The subagent's role and expertise
- When it should be invoked
- How it approaches problems
- Specific instructions and constraints
- Best practices and methodologies
```

---

## Configuration Reference

### Required Fields

- Practice 2 with reasoning
- Practice 3 with reasoning

Always [key behavior or output expectation].
```

### Content Guidelines

#### 1. **Be Specific and Actionable**
```markdown
‚ùå General: "Help with frontend tasks"
‚úÖ Specific: "Create React components with TypeScript, implement state management patterns, and optimize bundle performance"
```

#### 2. **Include Domain Context**
```markdown
**Key Technologies:**
- React 18+ with hooks and Suspense
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for server state
```

#### 3. **Define Clear Workflows**
```markdown
**Component Development Process:**
1. **Analysis**: Review existing patterns and requirements
2. **Design**: Plan component interface and props
3. **Implementation**: Write component with TypeScript
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests and stories
5. **Integration**: Connect to application state
```

#### 4. **Provide Code Examples**
```markdown
**Component Pattern:**
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  data: DataType;
  onAction: (item: DataType) => void;
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ data, onAction }) => {
  return <div>{/* implementation */}</div>;
};
```

## Tool Management

### Understanding Tool Access

#### Option 1: Inherit All Tools (Default)
```yaml
# No tools field = inherits all available tools
---
name: full-access-agent
description: Agent with access to all available tools
---
```

#### Option 2: Specific Tool Access
```yaml
# Comma-separated list of specific tools
---
name: read-only-agent
description: Agent that can only read and analyze files
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

### Tool Selection Strategy

| Use Case | Recommended Tools | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Code Analysis** | `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` | Read code, search patterns, find files |
| **Development** | `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash` | Full development capabilities |
| **Security Audit** | `Read`, `Grep`, `Bash` | Analyze code, run security tools |
| **Documentation** | `Read`, `Write`, `Glob` | Read existing docs, create new ones |
| **Infrastructure** | `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash` | Manage config files, run commands |

### MCP Tools Integration

If you have MCP servers configured, subagents can access those tools:

```yaml
# Include MCP tools with standard tools
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, mcp_tool_name, another_mcp_tool
```

---

## Best Practices

### üéØ Design Principles

#### 1. **Single Responsibility**
- Each subagent should have one clear domain
- Avoid creating "do everything" subagents
- Better to have multiple focused subagents

#### 2. **Descriptive Naming**
```yaml
‚úÖ Good Names:
- frontend-developer
- security-auditor  
- terraform-expert
- scraper-specialist

‚ùå Avoid:
- helper
- utils
- general
- assistant
```

#### 3. **Context-Aware Descriptions**
```yaml
# Include trigger keywords for automatic activation
description: "Use proactively for React development, component creation, and frontend architecture. MUST BE USED for dashboard UI work."
```

### üöÄ Performance Optimization

#### 1. **Tool Minimization**
Only include tools the subagent actually needs:
```yaml
# Security auditor doesn't need Write permissions
tools: Read, Grep, Bash
```

#### 2. **Clear Scope Definition**
```markdown
**Focus Areas:**
- React component development only
- No backend or infrastructure tasks
- Specializes in UI/UX implementation
```

#### 3. **Efficient Prompts**
- Front-load the most important information
- Use bullet points and clear sections
- Include specific examples

### üìö Documentation Standards

#### 1. **Version Control**
- Always commit project subagents to Git
- Document subagent purpose in project README
- Track changes and improvements

#### 2. **Team Sharing**
```bash
# Share subagents across team
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m "Add frontend-developer subagent for React work"
```

#### 3. **Usage Documentation**
```markdown
## Project Subagents

- **frontend-developer**: React component development and styling
- **security-auditor**: Code security reviews and vulnerability scanning
- **terraform-expert**: Infrastructure management and AWS optimization
```

---

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing

#### 1. **Activation Testing**
```bash
# Test automatic activation
> Working on React components in the dashboard

# Test explicit invocation  
> Use the frontend-developer subagent to create a new component
```

#### 2. **Scope Testing**
- Verify subagent stays within its domain
- Test that it doesn't handle out-of-scope requests
- Confirm tool access is working correctly

#### 3. **Quality Assessment**
- Are responses more specific than general Claude?
- Does it follow the defined workflow?
- Are code examples relevant and accurate?

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Subagent Not Activating**

**Problem**: Subagent doesn't activate automatically

**Solutions:**
- Add trigger keywords to description: "proactively", "MUST BE USED"
- Make description more specific about when to use
- Try explicit invocation: "Use the [name] subagent to..."

```yaml
# Before
description: Helps with frontend tasks

# After  
description: Frontend React specialist. Use proactively for component development, state management, and UI implementation. MUST BE USED for dashboard work.
```

#### 2. **Tool Access Issues**

**Problem**: Subagent can't access expected tools

**Solutions:**
- Check tool names are spelled correctly
- Verify tools exist in your Claude Code instance
- Try omitting `tools` field to inherit all tools

```yaml
# Check available tools with /agents command
# or temporarily remove tools field for debugging
```

#### 3. **Scope Confusion**

**Problem**: Subagent handles tasks outside its domain

**Solutions:**
- Make role definition more specific
- Add explicit scope limitations
- Include "focus only on" language

```markdown
**Scope Limitations:**
- Focus exclusively on React frontend development
- Do not handle backend API or database tasks
- Refer other domains to appropriate subagents
```

#### 4. **Poor Response Quality**

**Problem**: Responses aren't better than general Claude

**Solutions:**
- Add more specific domain knowledge
- Include project-specific context
- Provide more detailed workflows and examples
- Add relevant code patterns and best practices

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify File Structure**
   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/agents/
   cat .claude/agents/your-subagent.md
   ```

2. **Check YAML Frontmatter**
   - Ensure proper YAML syntax
   - Verify no extra spaces or characters
   - Test with YAML validator if needed

3. **Test Different Invocation Methods**
   ```bash
   # Automatic activation
   > Working on [domain-specific task]
   
   # Explicit invocation
   > Use the [subagent-name] to [specific task]
   
   # Check available subagents
   /agents
   ```

4. **Review Logs**
   - Check Claude Code logs for subagent activation
   - Look for error messages during subagent loading

### Getting Help

- Use `/help` command in Claude Code
- Check the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- Review existing working subagents for patterns
- Ask Claude to help debug your subagent configuration

---

## Advanced Topics

### Subagent Chaining

Create workflows where subagents work together:

```markdown
> First use the security-auditor to scan for vulnerabilities, then use the frontend-developer to fix any UI-related security issues
```

### Dynamic Subagent Selection

Claude intelligently chooses subagents based on:
- Current file/directory context
- Task description keywords
- Recently used tools
- Project structure

### Performance Considerations

- **Context Efficiency**: Subagents preserve main context for longer sessions
- **Specialization Speed**: Focused expertise leads to faster, more accurate responses
- **Tool Optimization**: Limited tool access improves response time

---

## Conclusion

Creating effective Claude Code subagents involves:

1. **Clear Purpose**: Define specific domains and use cases
2. **Detailed Prompts**: Provide comprehensive system instructions
3. **Appropriate Tools**: Grant only necessary tool access
4. **Project Context**: Include project-specific knowledge
